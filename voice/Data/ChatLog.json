        "content": "The origin of the discovery of zero is a topic of ongoing debate among historians and scholars. The concept of zero as a number and a placeholder in the decimal system was developed in ancient India in the 7th century CE. The Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata (476-550 CE) is credited with being the first to use zero as a placeholder in his decimal system.\n\nHowever, the use of zero as a number in its own right, rather than just as a placeholder, developed later in India and was popularized by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (598-665 CE) in his book \"Brahmasphuta Siddhanta\".\n\nThe use of zero then spread to the Middle East and eventually to Europe through the Middle Ages. The Italian mathematician Fibonacci (1170-1250 CE) is credited with introducing the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, which includes the concept of zero, to Europe in the 13th century.\n\nSo, while it is difficult to identify a single \"discoverer\" of zero, Aryabhata and Brahmagupta are key figures in the development of the concept of zero in ancient India."
